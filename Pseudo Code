This is my pseudo code for CSE3151 Python Logo Project

Firstly I will need to use the turtle python library.

# Screen Definition
create a new screen and set its background colour to white

#Turtle Definition
Create a new turtle
Set its colour, both the line and fill
Set the shape to turtle
Set the line width to large for a specific effect


#Shape Definition
Set the shape perimeter, this will be used for ratios.
Set the long side's ratio - multiply by a resize variable to make bigger/smaller
Set the medium side's ratio - multiply by a resize variable to make bigger/smaller
Set the short side's ratio - multiply by a resize variable to make bigger/smaller



#Angles
Set the angles of each side.
If the triangle has vertices A, B, and C, our angles are:
a = angle BAC or CAB
b = angle ABC or CBA
c = angle ACB or BCA

Create an array of seven triangles
Create an array of each colour

#Draw Shapes
Draw one big triangle, reposition, repeat.
The draw function takes in each side (length) and angle (size), with the outline and fill.
Begin turtle fill (to ensure shape has colour inside)
Set the colour and fill to the appropriate arguments entered in the function
Move forward the length of the long side, multiplied by our total shape size
Turn right the short angle (a)
Move forward the length of the medium side, multiplied by our total shape size
Turn right the long angle (c)
Move foreward the length of the short side, multiplied by our total shape size
Turn right the medium angle (b)
End fill to fill the shape
Reposition turtle (separate function)

#Reposition
Lift up the pen so the turtle doesn't draw a white line
Turn right a set amount of degrees
Move forward a set amount of steps (in a ratio to the shape's perimeter, the shape size, and our resize value)
Turn right 90 degrees
Continue forward a set amount of steps (in a ratio to the shape's perimeter, the shape size, and our resize value)
Turn right the medium angle (b) as this is the same way we face after finishing a shape
Put the pen back down, ready for the next shape

#Final Triangle Brute Force
